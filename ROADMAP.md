# ROADMAP
Aiming to boost real-world applications, we hereafter describe the potential updates for future releases of HA-ViD and call for collaborative efforts from the community.

Extending data and annotations:
- [ ] Extending the data to include more products, assembly environments, and different agents.
- [ ] Extending the annotations to incorporate more 3D and pixel-wise geometric information.

Supporting more tasks:
- [ ] Benchmark more assembly video reasoning tasks on HA-ViD, including two-hand collaboration understanding, human-object interaction recognition, and assembly scene understanding.
- [ ] Extend benchmarks to 3D space, such as utilizing 3D reasoning and 3D hand-object interaction estimation techniques to precisely track the temporal changes in the hand poses and objects.

Robot learning playground:
- [ ] Develop a simulation environment for different robots and the Generic Assembly Box assembly workbenck to boost the research on robot skill learning and human-robot skill transfer.
